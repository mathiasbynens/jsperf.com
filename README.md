# jsPerf.com source code

[jsPerf.com](http://jsperf.com/) runs on a server with Apache or Lighttpd,
MySQL and PHP installed.

## How to run a local copy of jsPerf for testing/debugging

1. Download the source code, as located within this repository.
2. The code expects things to be hosted at `/` and not a subdirectory. You
   might want to create a new virtual host, e.g. `dev.jsperf.com`.
3. Use `database.sql` to create the jsPerf tables in a database of choice.
4. Rename `_inc/config.sample.php` to `config.php` and enter your database
   credentials and other info.
5. If you are using Apache, edit `.htaccess` (especially the first few lines)
   so it matches your current setup. If you are using Lighttpd, set up the
   `dev.jsperf.com` virtual host using the sample in `_inc/lighttpd.conf`.
