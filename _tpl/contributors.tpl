<p><a href="/">jsPerf</a> was created by <strong><a href="//mathiasbynens.be/" title="Mathias Bynens, front-end web developer">Mathias Bynens</a></strong> and launched on August 1st, 2010.</p>
<p>On the same day, Mathias also created the <a href="//benchmarkjs.com/">Benchmark.js</a> project, which was originally a heavily modified fork of <strong><a href="//www.broofa.com/">Robert Kieffer</a></strong>’s <a href="//www.broofa.com/Tools/JSLitmus/">JSLitmus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Simon</strong>, of Google, was kind enough to extend the <a href="//www.browserscope.org/">Browserscope</a> API to allow jsPerf to programmatically submit new tests. This enabled jsPerf to use Browserscope to collect test results across different platforms, devices, and browsers.</p>
<p>In October 2010, <strong><a href="//allyoucanleet.com/">John-David Dalton</a></strong> started collaborating on Benchmark.js, separating it from the jsPerf UI, adding lots of awesome features, fixing bugs, and adding support for pretty much every JavaScript environment out there. JD quickly became the lead Benchmark.js developer.</p>
